-Smartphone-based cognitive-behavioral therapy poses a potential channel for disseminating mental health treatment to individuals who are unable to access in-person therapy. We developed Perspectives, the first comprehensive CBT app for body dysmorphic disorder BDD. Here, we examined the maintenance of treatment gains at long-term (6-month) follow-up. 
-In terms of BDD severity (BDD-YBOCS), patients not only maintained gains from post treatment to 6 month follow-up but even continued to improve significantly in this time. In terms of insight (BABS), gains were maintained from post-treatment to 6-month follow-up. These results suggest that improvements achieved via 12-week smartphone CBT for BDD are effectively maintained 6 months after treatment completion. This sample had severe BDD-YBOCS symptoms at baseline. Thus, app-based CBT led to maintenance of gains even for individuals with acute BDD.
