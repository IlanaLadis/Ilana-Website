Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common, chronic, and debilitating psychiatric illness (Buhlmann et al., 2010). Smartphone-based CBT poses a potential channel for disseminating specialized CBT for BDD to individuals who are unable or unwilling to access in-person therapy. However, it is unknown how well improvements in symptoms are maintained following the use of smartphone-based treatments (Donker et al., 2013). Given the severity and particularly the chronicity of BDD, it is imperative that smartphone-based treatments for BDD are capable of leading to long-term symptom reduction. We partnered with a telecommunications company to develop and pilot test Perspectives, the first comprehensive CBT app for BDD. Results from the initial pilot trial demonstrated that 90% of participants were treatment responders, with a large effect (d = 2.60; Wilhelm et al., 2019). While this study provides support for the preliminary efficacy of smartphone CBT for BDD, no study to date has examined maintenance of treatment gains at long-term follow-up. Thus, the present study aimed to examine maintenance of treatment gains from post-treatment to 6-month follow-up. Participants (N= 10) were recruited nationally and met DSM-5 criteria for BDD. Participants completed Perspectives on their personal smartphones over the course of 12 weeks and could access the app throughout the 6-month follow-up period to review content or practice skills. The Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD-YBOCS; Phillips et al., 1997) and Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS; Eisen et al. 1998) were used to measure BDD severity and insight, respectively, at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up assessments. Higher BDD-YBOCS scores correspond with greater BDD symptom severity, and lower BABS scores correspond with better insight. Maintenance of gains from post-treatment to 6-month follow-up were examined using paired t-tests. In terms of BDD severity, patients not only maintained gains from post treatment (M = 16.50, SD = 3.63) to 6 month follow-up (M = 12.10, SD= 4.70) but even continued to improve significantly in this time; t(9)= 3.30, p = .009. In terms of insight, gains were maintained from post-treatment (M= 5.10, SD= 1.45) to 6-month follow-up (M= 3.50, SD= 4.69); t(9)= 1.09, p = .302. These results suggest that improvements achieved via 12-week smartphone CBT for BDD are effectively maintained 6 months after treatment completion. This sample had severe BDD-YBOCS symptoms at baseline (M= 30.60, SD= 2.88). Thus, app-based CBT led to maintenance of gains even for individuals with acute BDD. Given the small sample size of the present pilot study, maintenance of gains following smartphone CBT for BDD should be further examined in larger trials.
