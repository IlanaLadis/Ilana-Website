I am a second-year graduate student at the University of Virginia studying clinical psychology. I work with Dr. Bethany Teachman. My research interests include the impact of daily state- and trait-level factors (e.g., insomnia; social support) on fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors. To this end, I employ mobile technology to assess intra- and inter-individual variability in affect and suicide risk. Ultimately, I hope that this research will inform the development of personalized, just-in-time interventions for individuals at risk for suicide.
